# k8s-scheduler-extender-example
This is an example of [Kubernetes Scheduler Extender](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/scheduling/scheduler_extender.md)

## How to

### 0. checkout the repo and make sure you have [`dep` installed](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html).

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:everpeace/k8s-scheduler-extender-example.git
$ cd k8s-scheduler-extender-example
$ dep ensure
```

### 1. buid a docker image

```
$ IMAGE=YOUR_ORG/YOUR_IMAGE:YOUR_TAG

$ docker build . -t "${IMAGE}"
$ docker push "${IMAGE}"
```

### 2. deploy `my-scheduler` in `kube-system` namespace
please see ConfigMap in [extender.yaml](extender.yaml) for scheduler policy json which includes scheduler extender config.

```
# bring up the kube-scheduler along with the extender image you've just built
$ sed 's/a\/b:c/'$(echo "${IMAGE}" | sed 's/\//\\\//')'/' extender.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

For ease of observation, start streaming logs from the extender:

```console
$ kubectl -n kube-system logs deploy/my-scheduler -c my-scheduler-extender-ctr -f
[  warn ] 2018/11/07 08:41:40 main.go:84: LOG_LEVEL="" is empty or invalid, fallling back to "INFO".
[  info ] 2018/11/07 08:41:40 main.go:98: Log level was set to INFO
[  info ] 2018/11/07 08:41:40 main.go:116: server starting on the port :80
```

Open up an another termianl and proceed.

### 3. schedule test pod

you will see `test-pod` will be scheduled by `my-scheduler`.

```
$ kubectl create -f test-pod.yaml

$ kubectl describe pod test-pod
Name:         test-pod
...
Events:
  Type    Reason                 Age   From               Message

```

## Code changes
@wangchen615 helped 
- restructure the code to wrap all shared functions and variables into a package `k8s-scheduler-extender`.
- use `dep` instead of `mod` to manage dependencies

### Use of the package `k8s-scheduler-extender`
```
import "github.com/everpeace/k8s-scheduler-extender-example/k8s_scheduler_extender"
```
The `main.go` is an example extender revised using the above reference.
